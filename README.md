# A digital book management system built using Java, Springboot-starter-web, Maven, REST APIs, JDBC, H2 Database and JPA Hibernate.

This branch (at this point) will be a snapshot of the goodreads application just before the application focus turns towards clean code and adding more complex entity relationships. Currently it has a footprint of its own evolution from hmap-storage -> H2 db -> JPA Hibernate. 

### We can use this snapshot as a reference for building a backend application from scratch.
