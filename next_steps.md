Next steps:

- [x] Secure endpoints using JWT (e.g. /books, /authors) (disabled for testing)
- [ ] Add JWT filter to decode + validate tokens
- [ ] Attach JWT in Postman with Authorization: Bearer <token>
- [ ] Build user-based features (like reading lists!)


My list (feature-pipeline):

    sign-up page (form)
    profile page
    my books section
    read/unread feature
    want-to-read
    add books manually - by users or with admin's approval (from frontend)
    admin access console
    Community section (for each book)
